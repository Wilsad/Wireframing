# Wireframing
## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a vital initial step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It consists of creating straightforward, low-fidelity visual guides that outline the structure and layout of a digital product—like a website or mobile app—without the distraction of color, graphics, or detailed content. Think of it as a digital blueprint that captures the essential framework of a page or screen.

## Why Wireframing Matters

- **Clarifies Structure**: It clarifies how elements are arranged on a page, ensuring that the hierarchy of content and navigation flow is logical.
- **Facilitates Collaboration**: Designers, developers, and stakeholders can align early on the product’s structure before focusing on aesthetics or functionality.
- **Saves Time and Resources**: Identifying layout or usability issues at this stage prevents expensive rework later in the development process.
- **Supports User-Centred Design**: Wireframes help designers concentrate on user journeys and task flows, enhancing overall usability.
